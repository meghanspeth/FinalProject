 <p> “I’m a good talker. But I soon learned that you can’t talk someone out of depression. Mental illness is real. And like everything else in life, it operates on a spectrum. Though there are common symptoms, everyone experiences it differently. Yet so many people live in shame, hiding their struggles, not seeking help. We, as a culture, have not fully acknowledged how much help is needed. The only real shame is on us for not being willing to speak openly. For continuing to deny that mental health is related to our overall health. We need to start talking, and we need to start now.”</p>

    <p> My name is Meghan Speth. I chose to focus on mental health because I understand its importance. I know of so many people who live with a mental illnesses. A few years ago, someone I know took their life and if you asked anyone you would never had guessed she was depressed and suffering. I believe that speaking out about how you are feeling can significantly help with finding the right path to feeling better. Mental illness is more common than many people believe. However, because of the long-standing stigma around it people do not understand the wide range of people who have a mental illness.Normalizing mental illness is important to me because if my friend had talked to someone then she could possibly still be here today.   </p>
