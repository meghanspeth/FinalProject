<h4>I have been relying heavily on the data from SAMSHA gov results from the 2017 National Survey on Drug and Health. I trust this source because it is from a government website that was performed nationally. Also the source has gone into detail about how they collected the data. The website has provided organized tables that help show a trend throughout the years. Additionally, the source has given me a wide range of demographics that help me better understand the multiple aspects of mental health on a national level.  </h4>

<h4>I used this source to better understand the reasons why people do not seek treatment relating to mental illnesses. It was a very eye opening set of data because I could see how a high percentage of the reasons people did not seek treatment was because of worrying about how others would view them. The data set helped connect my point about the need to break the stigma attached to mental health. I trust this source because they went into detail about the specifics of their trial and did not try to generalize their results. The results were specific to people who chose to self report and who were diagnosed with depression who endorsed a need for a treatment. So I take this data with a grain of salt but also I trust that they are making it clear the specifics of their data.
