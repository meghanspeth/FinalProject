    <h2 class="ActionHeader"> The problem</h2>
    <p> Mental health needs to be normalized in society today. For many years, therapy has had a stigma around it because people believed that it was only for “sick” people. However, mental health illnesses are more common than most people believe. Mental illnesses affect a wide range of people across the country. It is important to understand that mental illnesses are common. However, even today there are still stigmas surrounding this topic. The negative effects the stigma has does more harm for one’s mental health. If someone believes that mental health services like therapy or medication are only for dangerous or weird people then they will avoid seeking the right kind of treatment. People with mental illnesses will stay silent about how they are feeling and will not know that it is okay what they are feeling. People will not receive treatment because they have preconceived notions about mental illnesses. </p>
